### Hi there 	(￢‿￢ )

- I enjoy writing _neat_ open-source code;
- I am _currently_:
  - Working on anything involving java and/or Spring Boot.
  - Trying to improve my coding skills and getting as much practice as possible!
  - Fluent in Java;
  - Learning **Adobe Illustrator** and anything I can get my hands on!;
- :exclamation: Fun fact, I'm the last heir of my family;
- You can reach me on Discord , **chaotic neutral#9498**.
- I listen to tons of stuff, you can follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/hrn1isdy2ia8q7wfb1ew2fah6?si=cvwm72r4TbiDv-K7fF9VoQ).
